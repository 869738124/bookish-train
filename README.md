This project introduces a variable-stiffness elastic actuator that combines the principles of particle blocking, wedge structures, and pneumatic driving to enhance the rigidity of flexible robots. It presents an innovative solution to the challenge of improving the rigidity of flexible robots. Our actuator offers the advantages of online stiffness tuning, a broad range of variable stiffness settings, a compact structure, and rapid response time. Furthermore, we have established theoretical models for both elongation and lateral stiffness, validated through related experimental tests.
